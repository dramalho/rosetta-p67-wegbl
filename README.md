# Usage

The shortest path, assuming you have [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) installed is
typing

`grunt`

and pointing your browser to

`http://localhost:9000/dist/index.html`

This should compile the `rosetta_mission.coffee` file and install all the necessary vendor libraries, etc


# Credits


The models and textures were taken - possibly abusively, I need to clear this
up - from the **amazing** [Where is Rosetta](sci.esa.int/where_is_rosetta/) website, developed by [Science Office](http://www.scienceoffice.org/en/projectos/rosetta/)

Do head over to the website, it's mind-blowing and you'll get a feel for just how complex the whole Rosetta mission really is.
